# Power_node

## Node.config

You can find the example of `node.config` in [TP-Node configuration](./guides/tpNodeConfiguration.md) guide.

## Generation of `genesis.txt`

Generation of `genesis.txt` is described in [TP-Node configuration](./guides/tpNodeConfiguration.md) guide.

## SSL certificates

Generation of SSL certificates is described in [How to obtain an SSL certificate for a node](./guides/ssl-certs-for-node.md) guide.

## Starting a node

You can start a TP-Node either from Docker image, or from source code:

- If you would like to start your TP-Node from source code, use [this guide](./guides/startingTpNode_source.md).
- If you would like to start your TP-Node from Docker image, use [this guide](./guides/startingTpNode_docker.md).

## Starting a testnet

Starting the testnet is described in [How to install and start a testnet?](./guides/testnet-start.md).

If you use Vagrant to set up the development environment, refer to [Setting up the environment and starting the testnet using Vagrant](./guides/testnet-start.md#setting-up-the-environment-and-starting-the-testnet-using-vagrant) section of the guide mentioned above.
